#CIT_openuniversity
Collection of scripts and programs I've found helpful whilst studying Computing and IT with the Open University

These are not solutions to TMA questions, simply programs that have been created around topics covered by the course, some may help with studying particlar elements others are just exensions to content covered by the course.

They are groups be Stage then Module and hopefully the titles will give you an idea of what the program does although I'll leave a brief outline of the program below.
