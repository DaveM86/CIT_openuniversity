'''
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a well-known problem in AI and robotics.

Show the working used to calculate your answers. Give your answers in everyday units, for example using hours, minutes and seconds as appropriate.

i.An autonomous remote-sensing drone has been given the task of taking images over 14 locations and must plan a route to avoid running out of power.
Treating this as a TSP with the drone starting from one of the locations, how many possible routes might the drone take? Give your answer in scientific notation to 2 decimal places.

ii.If the droneâ€™s on-board computer can process 70 000 000 routes per second, how long would it take it to evaluate every possible solution? Give your answer to 2 significant figures.

iii.A proposed increase in the range of the drone would allow it to visit an additional three locations. How long would it now take the drone to evaluate all solutions?
